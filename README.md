# \#TrumpVerbatim [@VerbatimPOTUS](https://twitter.com/verbatimpotus)
A Twitter bot that tweets Donald Trump's tweets in real-time. Interacts with his account so you don't have to. Implemented using Node.js and [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit).

Conceived and built at the BuildHer 2017 hackathon, ***refined a whole year and a half later***.
